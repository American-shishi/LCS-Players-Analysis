# LCS-Players-Analysis
A look at LCS player statistics data-mined from lol.gamepedia.com

This was one of my earlier personal projects to identify stand out players beyond the top stats normally used.
With more experience in what I'm doing now, I am unhappy with the way I aggregated the data into one large table and I need to update it with better organization so that the analysis is easier to run.  But it's a project on the backburner for now.
